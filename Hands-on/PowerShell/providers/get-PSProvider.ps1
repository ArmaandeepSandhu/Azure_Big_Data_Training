## provides the PS providers information

#A provider allows access to data and components that would not otherwise be easily accessible at the command line. 
#The data is presented in a consistent format that resembles a file system drive.

#The data that a provider exposes appears on a drive, and the data is accessed via a path just like with a disk drive. 
#Built-in cmdlets for each provider manage the data on the provider drive.
